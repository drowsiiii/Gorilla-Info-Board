## Usage

### Location
The InfoBoard is located at coordinates `(-63.706f, 12.6442f, -81.800f)` for the nerds, but a better way to say it is at the small useless windows (You will see it) - easily accessible from the main lobby area.

### Navigation
- **Physical Button**: Press the "Change Page" button on the board to cycle through pages
- **Keyboard Shortcut** (when in desktop mode): Click the "Next Page" GUI button
- **Page Indicator**: Current page number is displayed above the button for changing pages, or on the gui just under the button

### Controls
